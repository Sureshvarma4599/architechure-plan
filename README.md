# Common Repository Architecture Proposal for Web Projects
## Online Consultation App as Example

## 1. Architecture Overview
The proposed architecture aims to create a centralized, reusable, and scalable repository that serves as a foundation for multiple web projects. This repository will include UI components, utility functions, and shared business logic. The repository structure will prioritize consistency, modularity, and ease of maintenance.

### Root Directory Structure Overview
The following is an overview of the main directories in the root structure:

```

```

### Explanation of Key Directories
- **`assets/`**: Contains all static resources such as images and fonts that are used across the application.
- **`components/`**: A collection of shared, reusable global UI components . Each component resides in its own folder, containing the component logic, associated styles, and unit tests.
- **`context/`**: Contains the global state management logic using the Context API. Examples include `authContext.js` for user authentication and `userContext.js` for user-specific state.
- **`modules/`**: Divided into domain-specific features, where each module contains its own pages, shared components, and logic. This promotes encapsulation and modularity.
- **`redux/`**: For projects using Redux, this directory includes action creators, reducer functions, and the central store configuration.
- **`services/`**: Contains service files for API interactions, abstracting HTTP requests and related operations. For instance, `authService.js` manages all authentication calls.
- **`ui/`**: A centralized library of UI components designed for easy reuse and customization (ex: button,Input,Textarea,Dialog,Alert).
- **`utils/`**: Includes utility functions that help with tasks like data formatting, performance enhancements (e.g., `debounce.js`), and other common operations.
- **`styles/`**: Hosts global CSS and theme files for styling consistency across the application.

## 2. UI Components
### Organization Strategy
The `components/` and `ui/` directories will house modular UI components that are shared across different projects. Each component will be designed for reusability and customization:
- **Modular Design**: Each component will reside in its folder with its JavaScript/TypeScript file, accompanying styles, and tests.
- **Customizability**: Components will accept props for customization, ensuring flexibility while maintaining a consistent look.

### Customizability Approach
- **Prop-based Customization**: Components will be designed to accept props such as `className`, `style`, and callback functions.
- **Theme Integration**: Integrate Tailwind CSS or other styling libraries to allow easy theming via utility classes.

### Example: Button Component Structure
```
ui/
└── button/
    ├── Button.js          # Main component logic
    ├── Button.test.js     # Unit tests
    └── Button.module.css  # Component-specific styles
```

## 3. Utilities
### Types of Utility Functions
- **Data Formatting**: e.g., `formatDate.js`, `calculateAge.js`
- **API Handling**: Centralized API calls with error handling.
- **Error Handling**: Generic error handler that logs or displays messages.
- **Performance Utilities**: e.g., `debounce.js` and `throttle.js`.

### Accessibility and Reusability
- **Modular Structure**: Each utility function will be in a separate file, making it easy to import only the required functions.
- **Index Export**: The `utils/` directory will include an `index.js` that exports all functions for simple imports.

### Example: formatDate.js
```javascript
export function formatDate(date) {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString('en-US');
}
```

## 4. Business Logic
### Managing Shared Business Logic
Business logic will be modular and domain-specific, residing in the `modules/` directory under each feature folder. Shared logic that spans multiple modules will be stored in a `sharedLogic/` folder.
- **Redux**: Use Redux for projects that require global state management.
- **Context API**: Use `context/` for lightweight state management needs.

### Modular and Adaptable Design
- **Feature-based Folders**: Each module will contain its business logic to promote separation of concerns.
- **Shared Logic Folder**: Common business logic will be extracted to `sharedLogic/` to avoid duplication.

### Example: Auth Context Setup
```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

export const AuthContext = createContext();

export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  const login = (userData) => {
    setUser(userData);
  };

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

## 5. Best Practices
### Versioning, Documentation, and Testing
- **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0`) for releases.
- **Documentation**: Maintain a `docs/` directory with markdown files for usage guidelines and API references.
- **Testing**: Include Jest or React Testing Library for component and utility testing.
- **Environtment** : Maintain different environment files for deploying
- **Styles**: Use libraries for styling to reduce css files while rendering client side
- **UX** : Use Suspense for better UX while laazy loading of components

### Recommended Tools and Libraries
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branch workflow.
- **Linting**: ESLint and Prettier for code consistency.
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Documentation**: Storybook for UI component documentation.
